Today we released our first public edition of the NRE Labs community stream. Today's episode included an introduction to the vast changes to the [`selfmedicate` tool](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-selfmedicate), which is an environemnt that spins up Antidote on your own laptop, so you can quickly and easily iterate on new or modified lesson content! Take a look:
