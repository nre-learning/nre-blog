We launched NRE Labs almost a month ago now, and wrote about it over on the Juniper forums on launch day:

> ... Providing a cheap, quick and easy solution, NRE Labs is free and easily accessible. It includes live terminal access to one’s own network devices and linux systems, right in the browser. Each learning lab topic is pieced apart into lessons that are, in turn, comprised of short lab steps that each take only a couple minutes. This is important because it eliminates those overwhelming obstacles to getting started with hands-on learning.
