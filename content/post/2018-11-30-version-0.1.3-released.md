We released 0.1.3 earlier this month, and since the production instance of [NRE Labs](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering) has
been running it for a few weeks, we want to catch you up on what's changed in this new version. This is a very exciting version
that includes new features, bugfixes, and importantly - four new courses for you to enjoy!

We'll be writing more detailed blogs on each of these lessons in the near future.  For now, here's a summary of the changes in 0.1.3:

## [Antidote-web](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web)

* The terminal pane's mouse issues are finally fixed! Thanks to Raymond Lam for this community bugfix! ([#17](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web/pull/17))
* The course page now randomizes which lessons you go to. This should help you discover new lessons more easily. ([#18](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web/pull/18))
* Moved mouse handler to previous loop that checks endpoint type (bugfix) [#19](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote-web/pull/19)

We're always working on new features and lessons, and will be releasing a new version sometime in December, so you have some new content to look at over the
holiday break.

Thanks, and enjoy 0.1.3!
